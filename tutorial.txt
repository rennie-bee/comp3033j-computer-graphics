The interactions in this project can be divided into 2 main parts: Camera & Human.

Camera:
When you enter the scene, you are in the default camera position and you can see there are two cameras (one is black and the other is white) hanging over there. To switch the camera position, you can use "C" (click fast or the system may regard that as multiple "C"). When you enter the black or white one, you can use "Z" or "X" to move left or right. I have designed boundaries for them so the camera can only move in a typical area. Whatever the angle and position you choose, the camera always focus on the match court. After moving one camera, you can switch to other 2 cameras to check the camera pattern also changes place and this is really realistic.

Human:
Apart from the match court, there should be another human with magenta color trousers. This is the human that you mainly interact with. Please use "UP","LEFT","DOWN","RIGHT" to move that guy (I recommend you to do that in white camera view since the moving direction suits your operations and that should be comfortable). Also, there is a bigger tennis in the court. You can operation the human to collect that tennis. Please use "MOUSE LEFT" to reach that. The human will bow and try to pick the tennis up. Unless the tennis is close enough to the human's hands, or it will not be collected. After collecting success, you shall see the tennis staying on the human's head and move together with the human. If you want to release that tennis, you can use "MOUSE RIGHT" to release and the tennis should be left around you and you need to collect again if you want.
